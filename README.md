# AIbasedDisasterReliefManagementSystem
The AI-Based Real-Time Disaster Relief Management System leverages artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to assist in disaster relief operations. By analyzing images of disaster-hit regions, the system identifies critical areas that require immediate intervention, optimizes the deployment of resources, and suggests efficient rescue strategies. This approach not only accelerates the relief process but also ensures that help is provided where itâ€™s needed most, thereby minimizing the impact of natural disasters. Furthermore, AI-powered drones and robots are revolutionizing search and rescue operations by navigating hazardous environments autonomously to locate survivors. Additionally, AI-based social media analysis allows for real-time monitoring of public sentiment and identification of urgent needs.
